# ✅ Extension Loading Issue FIXED!

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed**

The extension loading error was caused by:
1. ❌ **Empty `_locales` directory** - Chrome detected localization folders but they were empty
2. ❌ **No `default_locale`** - Chrome requires this when `_locales` exists
3. ✅ **Solution**: Removed empty `_locales` directory completely

## 🚀 **Extension is Now Ready to Load**

### **Load in Chrome:**
1. **Open Chrome** → Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Enable "Developer mode"** (toggle in top-right corner)
3. **Click "Load unpacked"**
4. **Select folder**: `D:\OfficialStuff\10Pearls\POC\AI\textToSpeachExt\dist\chrome`
5. **Click "Select Folder"**

### **Expected Result:**
✅ Extension loads successfully without errors
✅ "Intelligent TTS Extension" appears in extensions list  
✅ TTS icon visible in Chrome toolbar
✅ Ready to use on any website!
