## 🚨 Critical Security Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. XSS Vulnerabilities - CRITICAL ⚠️
**Issue**: Multiple uses of `innerHTML` without sanitization found in implementation
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Direct XSS attack vector
**Files Affected**: Multiple overlay and content scripts

```javascript
// FOUND IN CODE - IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED
element.innerHTML = userContent; // XSS VULNERABILITY
overlayElement.innerHTML = `<div>${text}</div>`; // XSS VULNERABILITY

// REQUIRED FIXES
element.textContent = userContent; // Safe for text
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userContent); // Safe for HTML
// OR use DOM methods for HTML creation
```

**Remediation Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix before any deployment

### 2. Content Security Policy Issues - CRITICAL ⚠️
**Issue**: Safari manifest includes risky `unsafe-eval` CSP directive
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Weakens CSP protection
**File**: `src/manifest/safari/manifest.json`

```json
// CURRENT - SECURITY RISK
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';" 
}

// REQUIRED FIX - REMOVE unsafe-eval
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
}
```

**Remediation Priority**: CRITICAL - Remove before production

### 3. Missing Dependencies - BLOCKING ❌
**Issue**: `node_modules` not installed, preventing build validation
**Impact**: Cannot validate builds or run development environment
**Fix**: Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### 4. Missing Assets - MINOR ⚠️
**Issue**: Icon PNG files referenced in manifests but not present
**Impact**: Extension icons won't display properly
**Files Needed**: 
- `src/assets/icons/icon-16.png`
- `src/assets/icons/icon-48.png`  
- `src/assets/icons/icon-128.png`
